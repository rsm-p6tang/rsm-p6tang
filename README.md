# 👋 Hi, I'm Peggy Tang👧🏻
I'm a recent graduate of UC San Diego’s Master of Science in Business Analytics program. I have 2.5+ years of experience in data, operations, and supply chain, and I enjoy solving problems with data and building clear, simple solutions for teams.

## 🌱 About Me  
- I have experiences with Python, R, SQL, and Tableau and I am still on my way learning and improving my technical skills. 
- I’m interested in consulting and business/ data analytics, and I want to pursue my career in the analytical field in the future. 
- 📫 Contact me: peggytang0513@gmail.com

Outside of work, I love learning and traveling. I enjoy playing golf, creating content, reading, and staying active through workouts and running. And in the winter, you’ll usually find me snowboarding. 🏂🏻
